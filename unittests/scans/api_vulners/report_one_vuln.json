A remote attacker can take advantage of this\n    flaw to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via specially\n    crafted queries to the resolver.\n\nCVE-2022-38177\n\n    It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the ECDSA\n    algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker\n    can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,\n    resulting in a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-38178\n\n    It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the EdDSA\n    algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker\n    can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,\n    resulting in a denial of service.\n\nFor the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 1:9.16.33-1~deb11u1.\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.\n\nFor the detailed security status of bind9 please refer to its security\ntracker page at:\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bind9\n\nFurther information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: https://www.debian.org/security/\n\nMailing list: debian-security-announce@lists.debian.org",
